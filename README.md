# owrxantswitcher
Plugin for OpenWebRX+ to switch antenna ports by adding some buttons to the UI and using a WebAPI on the server to do the actual coax switching.

In https://groups.io/g/openwebrx/topic/103251000 support for javascript plugins for OpenWebRX+ was announced.
I used the given information to build this ugly but working piece of code.

Beware: I don't really know a lot about javascript and how to use it properly (this is my very first attempt), 
so please consider the code to be at least buggy or plain broken.
